## Backend Routes & Middleware

### Middleware

We created three different sete of middleware that are used with our routes. These are:
1. mongoChecker
1. authenticateAdmin
1. authenticate
1. unauthenticate
1. multipartMiddleware 

#### mongoChecker

mongoChecker is used to ensure that the connection to mongo is up and running.

#### authenticateAdmin

authenticateAdmin is used as middleware for routes for the Admin panel, these routes are allow to be used by users that are Admins.  
The middleware checks the current session for the user to see a session exists and if the user is an admin by checking if the *user.isAdmin* propery is set to true.

#### authenticate

authenticate is used to make sure that a use is logged in, this is for requesting data that requires a users to be logged in to access.

#### unauthenticate

Is middleware for unauthenticated users.

#### multipartMiddleware 

Middleware used for uploading images to acces them from the request

### Backend Routes
#### Logging in and out
##### Log in

We have a post route
```
POST http://localhost:5000/user/login
```  
This route expects to received the username and password are JSON attributes in the body.

*Example Request Body*
```
{
	"username": "user",
	"password": "user"
}
```

This route is used to pass the login details entered by the user to the server, in our to check validate with the database. The password is compared to a salted hash.

The response of this request, is in JSON which contains the returned user

*Example Response*
```
{
    "id": "606db37aac310914b89e7564",
    "username": "user",
    "picture": "/images/profile.png",
    "isAdmin": false
}
```  
A cookie is also return.

##### Log Out

Logging out uses a get route.  
```
GET http://localhost:5000/user/logout
```  
No items are required in the request body.  
This deletes the session from the database, to stop the user from logging in again using the same session.

*Response*  
```
true
```

#### Registering a user
This route is connected to the sign up form. It is a post route that hits the endpoint `/user/register`.

*Example Call*
```
POST http://localhost:5000/user/register
```  

The request body for this post route should contain username, password and full name of the new user in JSON format.  

*Example Request Body*
```
{
  "fullName": "user 123",
  "username": "user123",
  "password": "my really strong password"
}
```

The successful response is some details about the user.  
*Example Response*
```
{
    "id": "606e1507c7b52310b6ae0a68",
    "username": "user123",
    "fullName": "user 123",
    "picture": "/images/profile.png",
    "isAdmin": false
}
```
#### Getting user details
A GET request with the username appended to end of the URL will return a user's detail. For this request to be successful it requires the user to be logged in. This is used to display a user's information on their profile.  
The endpoint is `/api/user/:username`  

*Example call*  
```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/user/user
```  

*Example Response*  
```
{
    "id": "606db37aac310914b89e7564",
    "username": "user",
    "biography": "I love MovieBook!",
    "picture": "/images/profile.png",
    "isFollowing": false,
    "numberOfFollowers": 0
}
```

#### Follow a user
A PUT request to the endpoint `/api/user/follow/` with the user name appended to the end of the URL. This is used to follow a user's which allows for their reviews to be populated in your feed.

*Example Call*  
```
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/user/follow/user
```

*Example Response*
```
true
```

The response is `true` when the follow or unfollow action is successful.

This is used to populate the movie page which the information pulled from the data base.
